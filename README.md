## Contributing

This is free for **anyone** to contribute to! (Especially if you are part of our team)  
If you would like to contribute to this repository; ✨amazing!✨ Just follow some rules:

<!---
Note: The links here will be updated whenever the issues, wiki, and discussions get set up.
--->

**Wiki**
- Before you edit anything in the wiki, prepose your change in the [discussion](https://github.com/J-The-Fox/FRC-Team-5098/discussions/3) first
- If you take images, text, screenshots, etc from somewhere else for the wiki, give credit to the original source or author!
- Spruce up the wiki if you like, add pictures and different headers. But try to stick to a similar theme throughout

**Code**
- If you're adding code, please make it well documented. We all would like to know what it is doing without digging around
- If you would like to add another WPILib project, make sure to ask beforehand.
- Stick to Java and Python if possible, but if you would like to use C++, make it well documented as our team uses Java primarily. (Would need to go in its own WPILib project)
- Add any examples you would like, can be related to the WPILib API or not. Any examples will help further the understanding of others

**General**
- Be civil and kind. Giving constructive criticism is okay, but at least be kind about it
- If you have any questions or have an issue, feel free to start a discussion or open up an issue
- Look in the [TODO discussion](https://github.com/J-The-Fox/FRC-Team-5098/discussions/4) to see what else needs to be completed. If you wanna add something or change something, feel free to ask

## Robot Setup

### Drive System

The drive system used is the Swerve X[^2]  
The motor that we use is most likely going to be the Kraken X60

However, due to issues with the Kraken X60s during the 2023-2024 year, we may revert back to Falcon 500s. The issue at hand was the Kraken X60s failing during matches where the motor would fail to spin at full rpm, sound terrible, and heat up very quickly.
During last season alone, we lost 3 Kraken X60s. Hopefully, during this year's 2024-2025 season, we won't experience as many issues. But the motors in use for the drive system are still up for discussion.

> [!NOTE]
> Other information will be posted whenever we have a more up-to-date design of our robot (and whenever we know what the challenge will be!)
